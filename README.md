# Useful tools



## This is a repo that contains tools that can be helpful for everyday use.

Currently it only contains two tools, but I will try to expand it in the future. Additionally, certain code snippets are AI-generated (like ChatGPT & Co). Why spend your time creating tools to help you in your daily tasks when you can simply use the power of AI?

### Tools short description

- `gclone.py` - *This code, when run with a GitHub repository URL as a command-line argument, clones the repository into a designated directory on your system. It automates the cloning process, making it easy to fetch repositories for further use.*
- `autoinit.py` - *This script streamlines the process of initializing and pushing changes  to a Git repository. By providing the repository's remote URL, default  branch name, and commit message as arguments, the script performs the  following tasks:*
  - Initializes a new Git repository.
  - Adds the remote repository URL.
  - Sets the default branch.
  - Creates an initial commit with the specified commit message.
  - Pushes the changes to the remote repository.




I will try to add binaries & co for other operating systems. Currently only .exe is available. To run it without `something.py`, just add the .exe ... path in your environment.

**Ideas are very welcome**

A lot of texts here are AI-generated because I'm lazy lol
